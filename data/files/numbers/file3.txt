"This is great!" The Doctor preened. "Me, interviewing Pamelandersonleetrundar!"

His father coughed. "Actually... she couldn't make it."

"What?!"

"It's all right, one of your old friends agreed to fill in."

"Who?"

"The Master."

"The Master?!"

"You were so close at school," his mother said. "And now he's famous, do you ever invite him around for dinner?"

"He's infamous! He keeps trying to conquer the galaxy!"

"He should have some good anecdotes, then," his mother said, unperturbed.

"Controversial guests equal chat-show stardom," his father suggested.

"Oh, all right," the Doctor sighed. "But only if he promises not to hypnotise the audience."
